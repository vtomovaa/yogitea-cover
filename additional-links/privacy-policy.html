            safeguards that we deploy inside the EEA.</p>

            processing purpose for which they were collected. Certain details and correspondence may be retained until
            the time limit for any legal challenges to the supply of the
            services has expired or in order to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such
            data. Data may also be retained for or included in analysis carried out by us with respect to our business.
