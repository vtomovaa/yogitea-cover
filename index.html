                                can always be better. That’s why we’re always working to improve the way we do things.
                                It’s this mindset that’s led us to create tea bags that are compostable, tea cartons
                                that are made from 100% FSC® – certified paper and use climate-neutral shipping for our
                                ingredients. It’s also led us to work with anyone, even other tea companies, because
                                here it’s not about competing to increase profits, it’s about collaborating to help us,
                                our industry, and the world, be better.</p>

                            already used as a spice in China in 3,000 B.C. Cinnamon is extracted from the bark of the
                            South-Asian cinnamon tree. It has an aromatic-sweetish taste and contains valuable essential
                            oils.

                            has been cultivated in the tropical heat of eastern Asia. It gives many of our YOGI TEA®s a

                        <p><b>Yogi Tea is a Game-Changer!</b>
                            <br>
                            I stumbled upon Yogi Tea during a stressful week, and it has quickly become my go-to
                            relaxation ritual. The blend of herbs and spices creates a soothing experience that helps me
                            unwind after a long day. The variety of flavors ensures there's something for every mood. My
                            personal favorite is the Bedtime blend; it truly aids in a restful night's sleep. Yogi Tea
                            has earned a permanent spot in my daily routine!</p>

                            inspirational messages on the tea tags add a nice touch to the overall experience. Yogi Tea
                            has become a staple in my tea collection.</p>

                            Yogi Tea has transformed my tea-drinking experience with its aromatic blends. The fragrant

                            have been a game-changer for me after meals. I love how the flavors are bold but never
                            overwhelming. Plus, the tea bags are individually wrapped, making it convenient for
                            on-the-go moments. Yogi Tea has elevated my tea time to a whole new level!</p>

                            <br>
                            Yogi Tea is more than just a beverage; it's a mindfulness practice in a cup. The carefully
                            selected herbs and spices not only tantalize the taste buds but also contribute to a mindful
                            and serene moment. I find the quotes on the tea tags thought-provoking and appreciate the
                            holistic approach to well-being. Whether I need a moment of calm or a burst of energy, Yogi
                            Tea is my trusted companion on this journey of mindful living.</p>

                            <br>
                            Yogi has struck gold with their Green Chai blend. The marriage of green tea with classic
                            chai spices is nothing short of brilliant. The tea is not only a treat for the taste buds
                            but also a feast for the senses with its enticing aroma. The ginger and cardamom provide a
                            gentle kick, making it a great choice for those who enjoy a spicier green tea experience.
                            Yogi Green Chai has become a staple in my tea rotation, offering a unique and satisfying cup
                            every time.</p>
